        Perception Horror is a genre of horror storytelling defined not by what
        is seen, but by how perception itself becomes unreliable. Emerging
        through the framework of RNC, it thrives on emotional and cognitive
        instability, making the reader complicit in the collapse of narrative
        certainty.
