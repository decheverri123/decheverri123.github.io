        If memories are rewritten with every recall, what is truth? Is factual
        chronology more trustworthy than emotional resonance? RNC invites us to
        interrogate the narrative authority of recollection—and whether
        remembering itself can become a kind of harm.

      <p className="text-lg text-base-content">
        Taken to its extreme, this paradigm questions the very foundation of
        identity. If the self is a product of memory, and memory is recursive
        and unstable, then who are we when the original memory has long since
        eroded—layered over by distortions masquerading as truth?
