        RNC is still an evolving framework, and <em>Blackport</em>—the novel it
        emerged from—is still being written. The ideas here aren’t presented as
        final or definitive. The website exists primarily to document the
        framework in case it proves useful to others, and to establish a record
        of its origin should it become part of larger literary conversations.
