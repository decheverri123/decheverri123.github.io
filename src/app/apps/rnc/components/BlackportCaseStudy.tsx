        Blackport: A Case Study in Perceptual Horror
      </h2>
      <p className="text-lg text-base-content">
        <em>Blackport</em> is the debut novel that gave rise to the
        Reconsolidative Narrative Collapse framework. It follows Luke Hadaway, a
        grieving and recovering addict who arrives in the coastal town of
        Blackport searching for answers about his missing wife. What he finds
        instead is a purgatorial nightmare where memory fractures the moment it
        is accessed, and where perception itself becomes a terrain of horror. As
        Luke encounters twisted denizens, warped architecture, and echoes of his
        own past, he—and the reader—begin to question what is real, what is
        remembered, and what has already been lost to the recursive
        deterioration of trauma.

      <p className="text-lg text-base-content">
        RNC is used extensively throughout <em>Blackport</em> to fragment the
        timeline, blur flashbacks into present action, and present trauma not as
        a past event but a looping, sensorial trap that rewrites itself
        mid-sentence. Scenes like the infamous "dessert collapse" are crafted to
        immerse the reader in the protagonist’s own psychological
        destabilization, collapsing memories of warmth into cold reconstructions
        that masquerade as tribute. By eschewing traditional transitions, the
        novel leverages RNC to make horror a function of memory itself. The
        horror is not what Luke encounters—it’s what he re-remembers.
