        RNC doesn’t just destabilize the character’s sense of reality—it
        destabilizes the reader’s. Memory transitions occur mid-line, flashbacks
        become moments of sensory entrapment, and familiar events contradict
        themselves on return. Readers begin to doubt what they remember from
        previous pages, realizing they’ve experienced the same collapse as the
        protagonist. The boundary between reader and character dissolves, making
        the act of reading complicit in the collapse itself.
