        Beyond Horror: RNC Across Genres
      </h2>
      <p className="text-lg text-base-content">
        While RNC first emerged through the psychological tension of{" "}
        <em>perception horror</em>, its recursive structure and perceptual
        instability open new narrative territory across all genres.

        Literary Fiction
      </h3>
      <p className="text-lg text-base-content">
        RNC allows characters to evolve not by action alone, but by recursive
        reinterpretation of their own lives. The narrative becomes an unfolding
        self-dialogue, where memory does not reveal truth but mutates it. This
        approach opens deep psychological layers with minimal exposition.
      </p>
      <h3 className="mb-1 text-xl font-semibold text-primary">Romance</h3>
      <p className="text-lg text-base-content">
        In romance, RNC complicates nostalgia, longing, and emotional
        recollection. A relationship might feel perfect in memory—until the
        memory fractures mid-scene, revealing darker subtext. Emotional stakes
        increase as characters question not only what they felt, but whether it
        was ever truly felt at all.
      </p>
      <h3 className="mb-1 text-xl font-semibold text-primary">
        Mystery / Thriller
      </h3>
      <p className="text-lg text-base-content">
        Rather than solving a fixed puzzle, RNC mysteries constantly shift their
        own logic. The detective may re-remember a clue differently, and the
        truth may no longer exist in any stable form. The mystery becomes not
        "what happened," but "what am I still remembering wrong?"
      </p>
      <h3 className="mb-1 text-xl font-semibold text-primary">
        Science Fiction
      </h3>
      <p className="text-lg text-base-content">
        In speculative genres, RNC offers fertile ground for stories where
        memory is technology, consciousness is malleable, and timelines revise
        themselves. Sci-fi grounded in RNC becomes a mirror not of external
        progress—but of internal collapse, re-encoding trauma into tech,
        identity, and civilization.
