    The staff appeared with the synchronicity I'd come to anticipate, each
    bearing a plate featuring an architectural marvel of custard and
    sugar—impossibly precise layers arranged in concentric circles beneath a
    dome of spun sugar that caught the light like blown glass.
    <br />
    <br />
    "The dish is finished with dehydrated hibiscus powder, crystallized elder
    flowers, gold leaf, —“
    <br />
    <br />
    —blueberries, flour, milk, egg, sugar, and that's it! Pretty simple but I
    love it. We call it leche asada. Or ‘roasted milk’ if you want to be a
    barbarian.“
    <br />
    <br />
    Her voice—unguarded, warm, alive—cut through the room like sunlight through
    the blinds of my Seattle apartment. Sunlight blazed through half-drawn
    slats, striping the kitchen in pale gold. Flour on the countertops. A
    crooked print above the sink. Mismatched mugs. The stack of consulting
    reports I’d abandoned on the coffee table.
    <br />
    <br />
    Marilyn stood at the stove, hair piled atop her head and secured with what
    appeared to be a pencil. A faded University of Washington sweatshirt hung
    from her shoulders, sleeves pushed carelessly up her forearms.
    <br />
    <br />
    A cast-iron skillet sat on the burner, its surface blackened by years of
    use. She'd brought it from her place, insisting that proper leche asada
    required equally proper tools. "This was my abuela's," she'd explained when
    she first carried it into my kitchen. "Three generations of Chilean women
    have made this recipe in this pan."
    <br />
    <br />
    "My mother made this every summer," Marilyn said, cracking eggs one-handed
    into a mixing bowl. "It was the one Chilean dessert that survived my dad's
    menu planning. He thought most of her family recipes were too ‘rustic’ for
    entertaining, but this one was simple enough that even he couldn't object."
    <br />
    <br />
    She laughed—a genuine sound that seemed to illuminate her from within.
    <br />
    <br />
    "Mama would teach me the names of everything in Spanish while we cooked,"
    she continued, whisking with practiced strokes. "Huevo, azúcar, leche. Later
    I realized it was her way of keeping her parents alive for me—I never got to
    meet them."

    Her wrist moved in perfect circles, each rotation revealing more of the
    woman I’d only known in snapshots of laughter and light in Blackport.
    <br />
    <br />
    “Jason never cared to learn,” she added, a shadow briefly crossing her face.
    “Not the recipe, not the Spanish, not any of it. He’d run off to play with
    whatever son had been dragged along that week—the children of men as
    ephemeral as my father’s whims. And sometimes, Jennifer’s. But I'd stay. I'd
    help Mama count the eggs in Spanish, practice rolling my r's while the
    custard baked."
    <br />
    <br />
    She poured the batter into the waiting skillet, where it spread in a perfect
    circle. “She’d tell the staff she needed to supervise this personally and
    made them all leave—but really, I think she just wanted ten minutes away
    from all the performance. Father wasn’t too keen on her teaching me Spanish,
    either. So this was our little place away from his omnipresent glare.”
    <br />
    <br />
    She glanced up with a smile that transformed her entire face—the kind I’d
    come to know as uniquely Marilyn.

    A glass slammed down beside my plate, liquid sloshing dangerously close to
    the rim. My head jerked toward the sound. A uniformed server withdrew his
    hand with uncharacteristic haste, failing to meet my eyes as he retreated.
    <br />
    <br />
    "—the finest example of culinary heritage preserved through innovation,"
    Bernard continued.
    <br />
    <br />
    Before me sat an architectural marvel of custard and sugar—impossibly
    precise layers arranged in concentric circles beneath a spun sugar dome that
    caught the chandelier light and fractured it into brittle rainbows,
    beautiful and cold. Nothing remained of the humble dish I’d once watched
    Marilyn prepare: no cast-iron skillet, no flour-dusted fingerprints, no
    warmth. Just perfection, sterile and unshakable.
    <br />
    <br />
    This wasn’t a tribute—it was PR erasure lacquered in sugar.
    <br />
    <br />
    I glanced at Marilyn. Her face had returned to careful neutrality, though a
    muscle worked silently along her jaw. Her hands—perfectly manicured,
    ringless, unblemished—rested on either side of her plate with deliberate
    stillness.
    <br />
    <br />
    "A fitting tribute," Jennifer remarked, lifting her spoon with choreographed
    grace. "We've preserved Helen's contribution to the Wheeler tradition while
    elevating it to reflect our current standards."
