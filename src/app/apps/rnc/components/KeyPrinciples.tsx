            Memory as Structure, Not Theme:
          </strong>{" "}
          The act of remembering is not just a motif—it is the engine that
          drives narrative collapse

            Flashback as Perceptual Entrapment:
          </strong>{" "}
          Flashbacks do not clarify—they destabilize and overwrite the present
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong className="text-primary">Trauma as Recursive Loop:</strong>{" "}
          Traumatic memory is not a static event, but a recursive process that
          rewrites itself with each recall

            Time Can Warp—Emotion Cannot:

          The timeline may fracture, but character psychology remains
          emotionally consistent

            Reader Realizes Collapse Mid-Fall:
          </strong>{" "}
          The transition should be seamless—but gut-punching in retrospect

          <strong className="text-primary">
            The Reader Is a Co-Conspirator:
          </strong>{" "}
          Readers are participants who must reconcile, question, and sometimes
          betray their own memory of the text
